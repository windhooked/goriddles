This started out as a collection of sofving simple problems with data structurs and algorithms in Golang. For data structures in c look at my implementations in github.com/windhooked/hdw_libc

|Data  Structures  | Golang | |
| --- | --- | --- | 
|Linked  Lists  |||
|Trees, Tries, & Graphs |||
|Stacks & Queues |||
|Heaps | ||
|Vectors/ArrayLists |||

| Algorithms | Golang | |
| --- | --- | --- | 
Breadth-First Search |||
Depth-First  Search  | ||
Binary  Search  Recursion |||
Merge  Sort  | ||
Quick  Sort  |||
| Hash Tables | ||


| Concepts |Golang | |

Bit     Manipulation  |||
Memory  (Stack vs. Heap) |||
Dynamic  Programming  |||
